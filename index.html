               around the legality of Uber in many of the cities that it operates in, it makes all the sense to find out more about the people most affected by this disruptive force; the licensed taxi operators.

               Traditionally, one would have to conduct laborous surveys, one taxi operator at a time. The data was initially retrieved by Chris Whong, a data visualization analyst, through a FOIL (Freedom of Information Law) request. In its entirety, it comes in at a whopping 18.7gb compressed.

               Ideally, we should first come up with a set of hypotheses before delving into data collection/analysis. This is to decrease the likelihood that we get caught in a frame that is overly limiting. <br>
               Our case here is a little special as the data has been handed to us on the proverbial silver platter. However, we should not let this luxury stifle our ability to get creative and imaginative about our analysis.
               <br>
               <br>
               First, let us take stock of what we have. The data is stored in two tables; trip_data and trip_fare.

            NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission

            reveals that the maximum legal number of passengers in a medallion is 4. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, it is pretty amusing to see the high instances of extreme honesty from medallion drivers with 5 or 6 passengers, or maybe its simply a case of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_error">
            fat finger syndrome
            </a>

            <h3>
               ii. Trip Time
            </h3>
            <p>
               The large number of negative trip times seem to suggest that many amongst us have mastered time travel. Unfortunately, we will have to remove them from our population. This can be easily done by requiring that trip time be equal to the difference between the drop off and pick-up times. This will leave us with quite a few trips where trip time is zero, which we will remove too. 
            </p>
            <h3>
               iii. Trip Distance
            </h3>
            <p>
               We will take a simple approach to this and simply remove all entries where trip distance is zero. 
               <br>
               A more complex approach will involve ensuring that the distance travelled is not smaller the cartesian (straight-line) distance between the pickup and dropoff points, as that is physically impossible.
            </p>
            <h3>
               iv. GPS Coordinates of Pickup and Dropoff Locations
            </h3>
            <p>
               Most of us are not geographers, and thank god to Google for the rescue. <a href="http://library.oceanteacher.org/OTMediawiki/index.php/Geolocation_by_Latitude_and_Longitude">Oceanteacher.org</a> tells us that the geo-coordindate system works by taking the center (0,0), a point somewhere in the Gulf of Guinea.
               <br><br>
               A +90 latitude brings us to the North Pole, while -90, you guessed it, represents the South Pole. Longitude ranges from -180 to 180, which sums up to 360 degrees.
               <br><br>
               We can definitely do better by removing all values out of range. According to <a href="http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/ny_geography.htm">Netstate</a>, New York spans a longitude of -79.4554 to -71.4725, and a latitude of 40.2940 to 45.042.
            </p>
            <h3>
               v. Fare Amount
            </h3>
            <p>
               As of 2010, the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/taxicab_rate.shtml">NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission</a> has set the initial fares to be $2.50. This makes our task of clearing the strange and hilarous negative fares a little easier.
               <br><br>
               Another area which deserves our attention is the large numbers of folks who appear to be over or underpaying their fares due to dodgy travel distances logged. We take a rather liberal approach here and remove any entries where the cost per mile is less than $2.50 or more than $30.00.
            </p>
            <h3>
               vi. Total Amount
            </h3>
            <p>
               While it appears that we're on an erroenous data zapping spree, this field deserves a second look. 
            <table class="tg">
               <tr>

               </tr>
               <tr>
                  <td class="tg-yw4l">$33.00</td>

               </tr>
            </table>
            Indeed, there are records where the only erroneous field is total_amount. Therefore, we will instead derive this field ourselves and ignore this field.

            <h3>
               vii. Attack of the Clones
            </h3>
            <p>
               We have come a long way to coming up with a cleaner dataset. However, you will notice an anomaly when you join the tables on medallion, hack license and pickup times.

               <img src="images/original.png" alt="duplicated september fares" class="inline"/>
               <br>
               The spike isn't due to people suddenly feeling great urges to take cabs in September. It is due to the fare data for September being duplicated in the trip_fare table, which we will have to account for and remove.
            </p>
            <h2>
               Let the Analysis Begin!
            </h2>
            <p>
               Putting it together, we arrive at a query that filters out records we identified as erroneous. It is worth noting that another person looking at this dataset will come to slightly (or totally!) different conclusions, and this is totally alright. The key is knowing how we arrive at our conclusions and being able to intelligently weight the pros and cons on the treatment of the raw data.
               <br>
               <img src="images/original_vs_cleaned.png" alt="original versus cleaned data by month" class="inline"/>
               <br>
               Across each month, with the exception of May, June and July, the cleaned dataset maintains the same ridership trends as the original dataset. This is definitely good news, as the general trends are kept intact.

               <br>
               Broken down by week, I'm certainly surprised and somewhat baffled by some of the findings.
               <br><br>
               <u>The Expected</u><br>
               There is a dip in ridership numbers that can be attributed to each major holiday observed in New York City, such as Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.<br><br>
               <u>The Baffling</u><br>
               What is the cause for the dip in Week 2? Is it because the Week 1 ridership numbers have been bolstered by the large throngs of people that need taxi rides home post their New Years' parties?<br><br>
               Equally baffling is the huge dip seen in Week 21.<br><br>
               <u>The Unexpected</u><br>
               The huge drop in ridership revenue in Week 31 came as a huge surprise. An <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2910202/Most-common-New-York-cab-driver-Mohammed.html">article</a> in the Daily Mail Online written by Louise Boyle appears to shed some light on this. In it, Seth Kadish, a data scientist, demonstrates that the most popular surname is, surprise surprise, Mohammad - and its alternate spellings MD, Mohammed, Muhammad, and Mohamed.

               The above plot, taken at face value, may seem to suggest that passengers paying cash are the personifications of <a href="http://www.watchmojo.com/suggest/Top+10+Stingy+Characters+from+Kid+Shows">Mr. Crabs from Spongebob</a>, and that the use of credit cards will magically result in more tips for the drivers.
               <br><br>
               This can't be further from the truth. Tipping NYC cab drivers is an established social norm, with many sites citing 15% to 20% as a good rule of thumb contingent on good service provided. The above result is likely due to cash tips not being religiously captured, while credit card tips are captured by the machine at the point of payment by the taximeter.

               Therefore, the next few sections will solely focus on the findings from our credit card swipping passengers.

               How Much Should You Tip?
            </h4>
            <p>
               Does the very thought of having to tip cause great anxiety in you? Give too little and be seen as a miser or too much and feel the pain of losing out.

               <img src="images/tips/tip_to_fare_percentage.png" alt="tip to fare percentage" class="inline"/>
               If you tip between 20% to 25% of the total fare, well done! You make up about 52% of the tipping population. It is also rather sad to note that not giving any tips is the 7th most popular choice, making up 3.32% of the credit card paid trips.
